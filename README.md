What will it do?
The code will find out all the MAC addresses of the devices connected to the network your are connected to.

It uses the broadcast packet and sends it to all the devices in the network to get response from the devices in your network.
To use it change the subnet in the code to your device's IP and networks subnet otherwise it'll not work.

Note: It only works in the same network.

Attackers use this technique to find out the MAC addresses of your devices and use it in MAC spoofing and other dangerous and unethical acts.
Feel free to ask any queries, I'll be happy to help.
